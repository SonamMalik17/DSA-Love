Q1281 : Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer

---> Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

Solution : 
class Solution {
public:
    int subtractProductAndSum(int n) {
        int r,pr,sum;
        pr=1;
        sum=0;
        while(n!=0)
        {
            r=n%10;
            sum+=r;
            pr*=r;
            n=n/10;
        }
        return(pr-sum);
    }
};


Q191 : Number of 1 Bits

---> Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Solution : 
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int o=0;
        while(n!=0)
        {
            if(n&1){
                ++o;
            }
            n=n>>1;
        }
        return o;
    }
};
